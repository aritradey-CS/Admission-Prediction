# Admission-Prediction
A machine learning approach predicts postgraduate admission for college students. Regression strategies (linear, logistic, extra tree, and support vector machine) evaluate admission eligibility in choice universities based on student profiles. Extra tree regression performs independent classification and regression.

The column chart titled "Distribution of University Rating" provides a visual representation of the distribution of students across different University Ratings. Each column represents a specific University Rating category (e.g., U1, U2, U3, U4, U5), and the height of each column corresponds to the count of students falling into that category.

From this chart, you can quickly understand the following:

The number of students in each University Rating category.
The relative distribution of students across different University Ratings.
The overall shape of the distribution, whether it's skewed towards higher or lower ratings.
It allows you to visually assess how many students belong to each University Rating category and get an overview of the dataset's distribution in terms of University Ratings.
